# Internal Reference

Indusferno is not a simple project at all. Some of the more 'mundane',
implementation-specific aspects are denominated as "internals".

In the codebase, they are denoted as files whose names are prefixed
with `i_`, such as `i_place.h`. Said aspects include:

* [Places](i__place_8h.html)
