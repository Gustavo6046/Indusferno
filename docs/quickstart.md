# Indusferno Quickstart Guide

This is a guide for quickly getting into playing Indusferno. It
is _not_ a tutorial for playing the game itself.


## Download

First, download the game from the
[Releases](https://github.com/Gustavo6046/Indusferno/releases)
page in Indusferno's GitHub repository.

Unzip the zip file somewhere. You will need both PK3 files in order to
be able to play Indusferno. That is, both "asset" and "code".


## Run

Move the PK3 files to your Doom II mods folder, and run your
ZDoom-esque port of choice with the both of them.


## Appendix

For more detailed instructions, please refer to
[Indusferno Verbose Setup](running.md).
