# Indusferno

If OpenTTD and Doom had a child, it would be Indusferno.

This is a partial conversion themed around the tycoon of moving cargo
around. Capitalist Doomguy realizes that there is much more potential
in hell to make money than he could have imagined, and now he wants
to make the most out of his hellish adventures as he can.

To this end, he will set up a transport network, funneling monsters
into death traps to harvest cargo from them, and moving cargo around
between industries to make more money and even new, processed kinds of
cargo!

Who would know those weird types were so ingenious in the
industrialization of the underworld.
