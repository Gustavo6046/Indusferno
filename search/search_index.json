This is a partial conversion themed around the art of moving cargo around, truly an industry in its own right. This project is built using GDCC and ZDCode in a process that is orchestrated by Ninja and Zake, respectively, and targets both ZDoom and Zandronum 3. The ultimate aim is to provide the first (and thus best) transportation tycoon simulator for ZDoom. It is, of course, still themed around Doom, but gameplay will be quite different. Please note that this project is in an UNFINISHED STATE , and still far from completion. It is not yet in a playable state, or anywhere near that; thus, do not follow any of the instructions for downloading or playing this project, at this current state of. the project. This is a Work in Progress . Thus, keep in mind that the remainder of this document is currently meant for an actual, finished state of this project in the near future, and read further.","title":"Home"},{"location":"about/","text":"About Indusferno The Creative Pitch. \"If Doom and OpenTTD had a child, it would be Indusferno... And it would be nasty and full of monsters. And also very monopolistic.\" This is a partial conversion themed around the art of moving cargo around, truly an industry in its own right. Capitalist Doomguy realizes there is potential in Hell to make money, and much more than he could have imagined; and now he wants to make the most out of his hellish adventures as he can. To this end, he will set up a transport network, funneling monsters into death traps to harvest cargo from them, and moving cargo around between industries to make more money and even new, processed kinds of cargo! Watch your empire rise, as the money keeps trickling in from all sides of your enterprise; or be a moron, and fail absolutely at moving any cargo, while your company is devoured by unpayable debts and ultimately dissolved, and back into the ground whence it rose. The choice is yours! [But you'll probably prefer the former! I'd bet!] Who would know those weird types were so ingenious in the industrialization of the underworld. The Vision and the Goals. Indusferno aims to establish a new bar for advanced ZDoom modding projects, at the vanguard of ZDoom mods, demonstrating what is possible within the realms of the ZDoom engine. It also aims to bring a whole new experience that has never been previously realized within Doom, one that would more easily fit into the simulation/tycoon game genre than that of first person shooters, while still providing a simple and seamless player experience.","title":"About"},{"location":"about/#about-indusferno","text":"","title":"About Indusferno"},{"location":"about/#the-creative-pitch","text":"\"If Doom and OpenTTD had a child, it would be Indusferno...

It does not describe how to play the game. Only use this as a detailed reference. If you ~~are a dummy~~ only need the gist of it, please refer to the Indusferno Quickstart Guide Downloading See the Releases section (of this project's GitHub repository), and download a pre-built package of this mod. You will most likely only need the \"rel\" build. Each build will include both an \"asset\" and a \"code\" PK3 files. You will need both of them to play Indusferno. This is so minor ZDCode changes that don't affect other assets only require the \"code\" file to be replaced with a newer version, without forcing players to download the large \"asset\" file yet another time. Using them is not complicated. Simply load both at the same time, as instructed in the section below. Running First, make sure you have those requirements met before you can run this mod on your computer. You WILL need a sufficiently non-ancient ZDoom or derived source port. This does include somewhat legacy versions, notably Zandronum 3.0 and above. Note that this entails the hardware requirements of whichever source port is chosen to run this mod; please consult the sourceport's respective website or documentation for details on that. Generally, you will also need the Doom 2 game data file ( doom2.wad ), but simply because this mod does not supply its own, and tries to match the aesthetics of Doom 2, as well as assuming a standard Doom 2 bestiary. It might still technically work with Freedoom, but it is not directly supported by Indusferno; there is no guarantee that the experience will be seamless. Please refer to the ZDoom websites for instructions on acquiring Doom 2 and obtaining the necessary doom2.wad file from it. Once that is done, it is finally time to run it: To run this mod on Windows, drag-and-drop the desired .pk3 files \"into\" the ZDoom executable; that is to say, hold the left mouse button in order to hold them, as if you were to drag them into another directory; then, instead of moving them, drag them into the ZDoom executable file, in the same folder as doom2.wad . If you know how to use the Command Prompt, you may also use that. For instance, with LZDoom, in a folder with doom2.wad in it: C:\\> cd C:\\LZDoom C:\\LZDoom\\> lzdoom.exe -iwad doom2.wad -file Indusferno-rel-assets.pk3 -file Indusferno-rel-code.pk3 To run this mod on Linux , the quickiest and most direct, way is through the command line. But fret not! It is a very simple and short command that has to be typed. Besides, this is how Doom used to be invoked, in a crude, bare DOS prompt. So don't be surprised that this appears here. Anyway, in order to do this, make sure you have a source port installed, then invoke it through the command line, passing the paths to doom2.wad and to the Indusferno PK3 files. # if you don't have a source port yet, install one, e.g. with LZDoom: $ sudo apt install lzdoom # on Debian/Ubuntu $ sudo dnf install lzdoom # on Fedora $ sudo pacman -S lzdoom # on Arch Linux, etc. # to run the mod, invoke your source port of choice with your files, eg $ lzdoom -iwad doom2.wad -file Indusferno-rel-assets.pk3 -file Indusferno-rel-code.pk3","title":"Setup-Verbose"},{"location":"running/#indusferno-verbose-setup","text":"This page describes very detailed instructions for downloading and running Indusferno.
